        Our 8-week regular season consists of 7 consecutive weeks of playing
        matches and building your skillset. League nights typically run for
        2.5-3 hours per league session. There is an optional 30-minute practice
        time before each of them. Week 8 is a double elimination playoff
        following official International Axe Throwing Federation Rules.
